# KillEventLogThread
 POC Find and Kills Event Logs Threads

This is something I've put together during Red Team operation for a customer,
it's not Pro code (I'm not very proficient with C++), it's not heavily tested,
it can be improved (you are welcome to do it and share back)

I got inspired by Invoke-Phant0m => https://github.com/hlldz/Invoke-Phant0m
but PowerShell being heavily detected lately I choosed to create the same
thing under C++ so this could be injected in some not so "random" Process.
